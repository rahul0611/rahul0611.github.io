>* Image gallery
>* Video player
>* Updates

I will explain in detail, there is strip of thumbnail of images at bottom of the application whenever you hover on the thumbnail an image with original resolution would appear. And video player, there is list of videos to select in right panel of the video screen, you can change the volume of the video. There is another tab called Updates, i have wrote a string which would scroll from right to left as a  feed with calendar. I have used different fonts for styling (ttf).
